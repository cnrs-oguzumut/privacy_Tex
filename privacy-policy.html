    <h1>Privacy Policy for LaTeX & BibTeX Tools</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 28, 2025</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>LaTeX & BibTeX Tools ("the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how we handle information when you use our application.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information or user data.</strong></p>

    <p>The App operates entirely on your local device. All document processing, formatting, and file operations are performed locally on your Mac. No data is transmitted to external servers or third parties.</p>

    <h2>Data Processing</h2>
    <p>The App processes the following data locally on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>LaTeX and BibTeX files that you choose to open with the App</li>
        <li>Formatted output files that you choose to save</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All file processing occurs entirely on your local machine. Files are only accessed when you explicitly open them, and saved only to locations you specify.</p>

    <h2>Network Access</h2>
    <p>The App may access the network solely to load the JSZip library from a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for file compression functionality. No user data or analytics are transmitted over the network.</p>

    <h2>File Access</h2>
    <p>The App only accesses files that you explicitly select through the file picker dialog. The App operates within the macOS App Sandbox security model and cannot access files without your explicit permission.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under the age of 13.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect any personal information, there is no data to access, modify, or delete. All data processed by the App remains under your complete control on your local device.</p>
